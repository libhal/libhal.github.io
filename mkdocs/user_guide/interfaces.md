# üîó Interfaces in libhal

## What are Interfaces?

An interface is like a contract between different parts of your program. It
defines what methods a class must implement, without specifying how they should
work. This is powerful because it lets you:

- Write code that works with any hardware that follows the interface
- Switch hardware without changing your application code
- Test your code more easily

For example, if you write code using the `hal::input_pin` interface, it will
work with any microcontroller that provides an implementation of that interface.

## Understanding Virtual Functions in C++

A quick note about virtual functions (which libhal uses extensively):

1. **They don't require heap memory**: Virtual functions work fine with
   stack-allocated objects.
2. **Performance impact is minimal**: The overhead is usually just one pointer
   lookup.
3. **Memory overhead is small**: Each class with virtual functions needs only
   one vtable (shared between all instances).

Example of using virtual functions efficiently:

```cpp
// This works fine - no heap allocation needed
hal::lpc4078::i2c i2c2(2);  // Stack allocated
initialize_display(i2c2);   // Uses virtual functions, but still efficient
```
