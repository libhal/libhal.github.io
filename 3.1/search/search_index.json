By using precompiled binaries,   the compiler has less work to do because portions of the code have already   been compiled. It doesn't need to parse and compile the same headers over and   over again. Developers will refuse to use libhal if it results in extremely   long compilation times. They will tire of the project and seek faster to   compile alternatives.</li> <li>\u2705 Consistency: With precompiled binaries, you can be sure that the same   code will be compiled in the same way, which can reduce inconsistencies   between different environments or build configurations. libhal will not be   taken seriously if libhal didn't use prebuilt binaries and also support   producing them.

Updates to the program   can also be handled by replacing the old binaries with the new ones, without   requiring the end-user to handle the compilation process.

The process of implementing prebuilt binaries required adding additional architecture settings, required the use of conan profiles to make the arm-gnu-toolchain available globally for all packages, figuring out how to insert architectural compiler flags and ensure they propogate to all packages took time and was a complex process.

The input to the <code>write</code> function only accepts values from <code>0.0f</code> to <code>1.0f</code>. If value is greater or smaller than this then it is undefined behavior. The developer, to eliminate this undefined behavior they must do the following: <code>dac.write(std::clamp(value, 0.0f, 1.0f))</code>. This works. The concern here is that now all code that calls this function MUST add this clamp to ensure that the behavior is well defined OR have some other mechanism in place to ensure that value does no exceed the narrow contract of the <code>write</code> function. This becomes a vector for bugs and issues in the code. This viral behavior also leads to duplication of the same clamp code throughout the application developer's code as well as the interface implementation code. A well designed implementation would either check that the input is within the bounds allowed and potentially emit an error or clamp the value for the user. Now the clamp code is performed at the call site as well as the implementation. This is a waste of cycles and space.</p> <p>Consider:</p> <p>Consider what the caller of API will have to do in order to use your API correctly as well as the implementor of the API. In the example above, the solution to this viral behavior is to make the narrow contract into a wide contract where the public API clamps the input for the user, making all input (besides <code>NaN</code>), valid input. That way, the caller can be assured that their input will be clamped and the implementor can be assured that the value they get will ALWAYS be the expected values.</p> <p>Viral behavior can come in different forms that narrow and wide contracts, so great consideration must be taken when writing an API to eliminate such viral behavior.</p>"},{"location":"contributor_guide/interface_design/#private-virtual-functions","title":"Private virtual functions","text":"<p>Make virtual functions private.

The first causes code bloat in terms of code size, and visual noise to the reader due to the code needed to clamp the input to motor's <code>power()</code> API. The second will cause potentially severe and hard to find bugs in the code which is unacceptable. To resolve this issue, the public API was updated to clamp the input from the caller before passing the info to the virtual API.

More and more of the embedded world move away from C and towards C++. This has to do with the many benefits of C++ such as type safety, compile time features, meta-programming, multi-paradigm and much more. When these features are used correctly, they can result in smaller binary sizes and higher performance code than in C.</p> <p>But a problem that embedded C++ software suffers is that there isn't a consistent and common API for embedded libraries. Looking around, you will find that each hardware vendor has their own set of libraries and tools for their specific products. If you write a driver on top of their libraries, you will find that your code will only work for that specific platform/product. In some cases you may also be limited to just their toolchain. You as the developer are locked in to this one specific setup. And if you move to another platform, you must do the work of rewriting all of your code again.</p> <p>libhal seeks to solve this issue by creating a set of generic interfaces for embedded system concepts such as serial communication (UART), analog to digital conversion (ADC), inertial measurement units (IMU), pulse width modulation (PWM) and much more. The advantage of building a system on top of libhal is that higher level drivers can be used with any target platform whether it is a stm32, a nxp micro controller, a RISC-V, or is on an embedded linux.</p> <p>This project is inspired by the work of Rust's embedded_hal and follows many of the same design goals.</p> <p>libhal's design goals:</p> <ol> <li>Serve as a foundation for building an ecosystem of platform agnostic drivers.</li> <li>Must abstract away device specific details like registers and bitmaps.</li> <li>Must be generic across devices such that any platform can be supported.</li> <li>Must be minimal for boosting performance and reducing size costs.</li> <li>Must be composable such that higher level drivers can build on top of these.</li> <li>Be accessible through package mangers so that developers can easily pick and    choose which drivers they want to use.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"project_information/about/#software-copyrights","title":"Software Copyrights","text":"<p>This source code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 as described in the LICENSE file.</p>"},{"location":"project_information/about/#third-party-library-licenses","title":"Third Party Library Licenses","text":"<ul> <li>tl-function-ref/1.0.0, CC0</li> </ul>"},{"location":"project_information/status/","title":"\ud83d\udfe2 Library Status \ud83d\udd34","text":"<p>Repo</p> <p>CI State</p> <p>Coverage</p> <p>Latest Version</p> libhal/libhal-__platform__ libhal/libhal-stm32f1 libhal/libhal-esp8266 libhal/libhal-__device__ libhal/libhal-mpu libhal/libhal-pca libhal/libhal-rmd libhal/libhal-tmp libhal/libhal-mock libhal/libhal-soft libhal/libhal-lpc40 libhal/libhal-util libhal/libhal libhal/libhal-armcortex libhal/libhal-canrouter libhal/libhal-micromod libhal/libhal-mpl libhal/libhal-freertos"},{"location":"user_guide/debugging/","title":"\ud83c\udfaf Debugging Code with PyOCD","text":""},{"location":"user_guide/debugging/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>PyOCD is an open-source Python package for programming and debugging Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP.

This can be done by writing the following bit of code:</p> <pre><code>void check_if_device_is_valid(/* ... */) {\n  constexpr hal::byte expected_id = 0xAD;\n\n  // Get ID info from device ...\n\n  if (expected_id != retrieved_id) {\n     throw hal::no_such_device(this, expected_id);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>And to catch the thrown error you do this following:</p> <pre><code>void bar() {\n  try {\n    check_if_device_is_valid(/* ... */);\n  } catch(const hal::no_such_device&amp; p_error) {\n    // do something using the error info.\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that this is a simplified example.</p> <p>The <code>throw</code> keyword functions similarly to other languages, where you can throw or raise an error object. This exits the function's scope without returning normally. This action causes the system to revert the CPU's state back to the state of the try scope. The exception mechanism then moves the CPU's program counter to the correct catch block based on the thrown type. In this case, since we threw <code>hal::no_such_device</code>, the catch block for that type will be selected. If no catch blocks are present with a valid error type in any scope from which the error object was thrown, then <code>std::terminate()</code> is called.</p> <p>Everything within the scope of the try block is no longer valid memory. The significance of this is that the exception unwinding mechanism can and must skip spending cycles on constructing and bubbling objects from a lower stack frame to a higher one. Since the thrown object is the only thing that escapes the scope, any information needed for error handling should be copied to the thrown object as it is being thrown.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/error_handling/#halexception-hierarchy","title":"<code>hal::exception</code> hierarchy","text":"<p>libhal has a hierarchy of errors, which looks like the following:</p> <pre><code>hal::exception\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 hal::no_such_device\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 hal::stm32f1::i2c_core_dump_io_error\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 hal::io_error\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 hal::lpc40::i2c_core_dump_io_error\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 hal::timed_out\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 hal::unknown\n</code></pre> <p><code>hal::exception</code> is the base exception for all libhal exceptions and is typically not thrown directly.
